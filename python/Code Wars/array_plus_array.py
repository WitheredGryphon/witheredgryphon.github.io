I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

(Developer Note: this was the Kana's description, not me asking for help)

def array_plus_array(arr1,arr2):
    return sum(arr1) + sum(arr2)
